This is a simple script to automate importing of Citibank Credit Card Statements into Zoho Books. Earlier Zoho Books used to support direct upload of Citibank credit card statements, but for the past 6 months or so this is not possible using the default interface. This script will allow users to generate an *.xls file in the Zoho Compatible format and upload the same to Zoho Books.

>Open the Citi Bank Credit card statement.
>Copy all the transactions into a text file.
?Change the name of the text file in the code to the name of the text file.
>Run the script.
>Your *.xls file should be ready.

Cheers,

This is made available as is, please verify your transactions before uploading them.
